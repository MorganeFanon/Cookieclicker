## Introduction
In this project, we were asked by Becode to make a Cookie Clicker in teams of three persons.
The latest version of our code is located in the main branch.


## What our Cookie Clicker does
Our cookie Clicker has the following functionalities:

*  **A Multiplier** 
    + To multiply by two the number of cookies per second.
    + The cost of a multiplier is 20 cookies.
* **An AutoClicker**
    + To be able to buy more cookies.
    + The cost of a multiplier is 12 cookies.
* **A button to buy a Cookie fabric**
    + To enable the purchase of a cookie factory.
    + The cost of a cookie factory is 15 cookies.



## Duration
The duration of the challenge was 4 days. The work has been performed **remotely** but also **on location** (1 day).

## How
The programming languages used for the project were HTML, CSS and JavaScript;

The different tasks consisted in back-end and front-end manipulations. We all three did some front-end and back-end. 

Some Websites we used:
* www.lasonotheque.org 
* www.dinosoria.com
* www.mixkit.com

### Why not a clear separation of the tasks? 
Example: to add a "bat" **cursor** to the project:
If you want to add an object like a cursor only in front-end (HTML and CSS), you also have to add the back-end part in JavaScript at the same time.

### Split screen
We decided to divide our window in two parts by creating two **div** in HTML. \
`<div class="split left"></div>` \
`<div class="split right"></div>`
